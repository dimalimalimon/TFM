# Object Detection in Lung Cancer CT Scans using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning

This repository contains the code and materials for my Master's thesis titled "Object Detection in Lung Cancer CT Scans using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning." The aim of this research project is to develop an effective object detection system for early detection of lung cancer in CT scans using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Overview

- The "train\_test\_split" directory contains the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for model training, evaluation, and inference.
- There is no data directory since it is too big to be uploaded to github.
- The "plots" directory contains the resulting plots for the predicted bboxes of the images. 
- The main directory contains all the code with the model and training in it.

## Dependencies

To run the code and reproduce the results, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.11.0
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Please refer to the individual code files for additional dependencies, if any.
